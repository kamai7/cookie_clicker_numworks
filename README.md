A basic cookie clicker game for numworks calculators.
this game implements:
- buildings, who automatically generate cookies each second
- upgrades: upgrades will appear in the two boxes every 20 seconds and give buffs
- a beautiful cookie made in pixel art

the save and stats button dont work because I-ve reached the maximum size of file that numworks can support
