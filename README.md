# Cookie clicker For Numworks `numworks_cookie_clicker.py`
A basic cookie clicker game for numworks calculators.
this game implements:
- buildings, who automatically generate cookies each second
- upgrades: upgrades will appear in the two boxes every 20 seconds and give buffs
- a beautiful cookie made in pixel art

the save and stats button dont work because I've reached the maximum size of file that numworks can support

# Noise generation algorithm (by me) `noise.py`
The algorithm works with a pointer that move randomly in 2D space: \
First place the pointer at the center of the spac, and set the value of tise cell to the maximum value. \
Then repeat these steps as many times as you want:
1. Move randomly to one of the eight neighbor cells
2. Set the value of the current cell to be the same as the last cell
3. Add a random variation (from a given range) to the current cell's value

Two functions are also implemented to blur the resulting space.
